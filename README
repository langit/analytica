The theorem prover ANALYTICA is an attempt to prove nontrivial
theorems in analysis. It is build on top of Mathematica. To run it,
type "math" to start mathematica. Then load file "index.all" in order
to load in the prover. The files are grouped in a hierarchical way,
with "index.all" being the root. All file ends with ".eg" are the
examples files. Subdirectory "examples" contains the following files:

simple.eg     --   some simple theorems in elemently algebra.
induction     --   Two theorems proved by induction.
summation.eg  --   Theorems about summation and pruducts.
fibonacci.eg  --   Theorems about Fibonacci numbers.
sp.eg         --   Properties of the Steorographic projection.
nondiff.eg    --   An everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable function.


Example of running analytica:


math
<<index.all
<<examples/simple.eg




OR

math
<<index.all
Prove[imp[0 < a < b, b^3 - a^3 > (b - a)^3]];
